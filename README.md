Friending is an online dating, friendship, and social networking mobile application.

## Abstract

Friending is an online dating, friendship, and social networking mobile application that features user-created questionnaires and multiple choice questions. Friending has two primary features: joining groups to find people similar to you or registering for events happening in
your local area.  Friending is a mobile app prototype built with Proto.io mobile app prototyping tool.

The Friending prototype was built as part of the design of a requirements specification project.  Friending was built for a user manual (UM), in order to ensure that the screenshots in the user manual were visually consistent and believable.  The User Manual was designed with the goal of _deceiving_ the reader into believing that the application actually existed.  Proto.io was the perfect tool to accomplish this goal.

## GitLab CI

This project's manual is built by [GitLab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-ci/), following the steps defined in [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](.gitlab-ci.yml).  It will download the latest build of `friending-manual` and convert it to a HTML representation.

## Proto io

Proto.io is a web service to create fully-interactive high-fidelity prototypes that look and work exactly like your app should. No coding required.  Using Proto.io you can quickly design and prototype design ideas.
